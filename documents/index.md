Nib is a static site generator with a full content pipeline.  Nib knows the
difference between static resources and markup documents, and uses a two-pass
rendering pipeline to first generate document contents and then render the
generated document output into the final page template.  Nib supports any
number of document markup formats or resource transformations, as well as
virtual pages generated during the build process.
